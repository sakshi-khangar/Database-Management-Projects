## Inventory and Warehouse Management System
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is part of my **SQL Internship Projects**.  
The aim is to design a **SQL backend system** for tracking warehouse inventory, managing suppliers, and automating stock alerts.  

It includes:
- Database schema with tables for suppliers, products, warehouses, stock, and notifications
- Sample data insertion
- Queries for stock levels and reorder alerts
- Trigger for low-stock notifications
- Stored procedure to transfer stock between warehouses

## Tools Used 
â€¢ MySQL 
â€¢ MySQL Workbench (for queries and ER diagram)

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be applied to solve real-world problems in inventory and warehouse management.
It covers:
- Schema design
- Data insertion
- Queries for monitoring stock
- Trigger-based automation
- Stored procedure for stock transfers
This project can be extended for real-world inventory systems with features like order management, billing, and supplier performance tracking.
