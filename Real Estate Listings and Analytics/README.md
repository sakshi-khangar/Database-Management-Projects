# Real Estate Listings and Analytics
## Project Overview
This project tracks real estate property listings and generates analytics for price trends and high-demand areas.
The database stores information about properties, agents, buyers, and transactions. SQL queries are used to calculate average prices, identify high-demand cities, and analyze price trends.

## Objective
- Track property listings across cities.
- Analyze property prices and trends.
- Identify high-demand areas for market insights.

## Tools Used
Database: MySQL (Workbench)
Client: MySQL Workbench
Export Format: CSV

## Database Schema (Tables)
- Agents – Stores agent information.
- Buyers – Stores buyer information.
- Properties – Stores property listings with price, city, and agent details.
- Transactions – Records property sales with buyer information.

## ER Diagram
Shows relationships between tables: Agents, Buyers, Properties, and Transactions.

## Exported Reports (CSV)
All query results are exported to CSV files for further analysis:
- Average Price by City
- High-Demand Areas
- Price Trends
  
## Steps Involved
- Create the RealEstateAnalytics database in MySQL Workbench.
- Create tables: Agents, Buyers, Properties, Transactions.
- Insert mock data into all tables.
- Run SQL queries for analysis (average price, high-demand areas, price trends).
- Export query results to CSV files.
- Visualize database structure with ER diagram.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates how to track and analyze real estate data using SQL. 
Queries and views help identify high-demand areas and price trends, while exported CSV reports provide actionable insights.
This system is useful for buyers, agents, and analysts to make informed decisions.
